    <p>welcome to toky++ 1.0.1, whats new?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>toky++ is now open source!<br>
        this was mainly done to prove the trolls saying it was an ip grabber wrong.<br>
        also, you can now host your own toky++ instance if this one is too slow?<br>
        oh. and the whole "fixing my terrible code for me" thing. :^)</li>
    </ul>

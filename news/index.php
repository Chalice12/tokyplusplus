    <ul>
        <li>themes! - go check them out in the settings menu.<br>though, there are only two so far...<br>also, dark mode is available, if you didnt already know!</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>past versions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.0.1</li>
        <li>toky++ is (still) now open source!<br>
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/miniwa/tokyplusplus">https://gitlab.com/miniwa/tokyplusplus</a><br>
        this was mainly done to prove the trolls saying it was an ip grabber wrong.<br>
        also, you can now host your own toky++ instance if this one is too slow?<br>
